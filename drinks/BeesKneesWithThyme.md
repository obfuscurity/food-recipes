# Bee's Knees with Thyme

Contributed by [xaprb](https://github.com/xaprb).

This special version of Bee's Knees adds thyme for a delicate but distinctive flavoring.

## Ingredients

* 2 oz gin
* Juice of 1/2 a lemon
* 3/4 oz honey
* 1 1/4 oz thyme tea

## Directions

Boil a little filtered water and sprinkle it generously with thyme. It only
needs to boil for a few moments. Then filter it through a coffee filter or other
fine material into a mug.

While the water heats, juice the lemon and combine the lemon juice and gin in a
glass. When the thyme tea is ready, mix 1.25 ounces of it with the honey, and
stir to dissolve. Add the honey-thyme tea to the gin and juice, throw in 2 or 3
ice cubes, and either stir or shake, as you prefer.
