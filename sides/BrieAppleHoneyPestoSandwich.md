# Brie, Apple, Honey, and Pesto Sandwich

This is practically the definition of a gourmet comfort-food lunch, and it's made from ordinary things you probably have just lying around your kitchen.

## Ingredients

* 2 slices of bread
* Brie cheese
* 1 Apple
* 1 tbsp basil pesto sauce
* 1 tsp honey

## Directions

Wash and thin-slice the apple, and lay it on one of the pieces of bread. (An apple is usually enough for two sandwiches.) Thin-slice some brie and place it on the apple. If your brie is soft enough, you can just spread it, or you can heat it briefly and spread it. But when I make this sandwich, I'm typically not in the mood for "just a little" brie.

Spread some pesto sauce on the other piece of bread, drizzle it with a little honey, and put it together.
